# Portfolio Rewrite

My current portfolio website is very basic and written in plain HTML, CSS and JS hosted on Github pages

Here is my attempt at rewriting what I have already made there but using React with Typescript and Tailwind instead.

Once this is sufficiently built it will replace the code in my original portfolio repository.
